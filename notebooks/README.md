# Notebooks

Use this directory to store computational notebooks (e.g., [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [marimo](https://marimo.io/)). 

The recommended naming convention is an order number, the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.:

    1.0-jd-initial-model-analysis.[ipynb | py]
